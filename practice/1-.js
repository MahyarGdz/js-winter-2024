// Variables:

// Declare a variable called isRaining and assign it a boolean value representing whether it's raining or not. Write a conditional statement that logs "Bring an umbrella" if it's raining (isRaining is true) and "Enjoy the weather" otherwise.

// Declare a variable called myArray and assign it an array containing three elements of your choice. Then, log the second element of the array to the console.

// Basic Function Declaration :

// Write a function called calculateArea that takes two parameters length and width representing the dimensions of a rectangle. Inside the function, calculate the area of the rectangle (area = length * width) and log the result.

// Write a function called greetPerson that takes a parameter name representing a person's name. Inside the function, construct a greeting message using the provided name (e.g., "Hello, mahyar") and log the greeting.

// Write a function called calculateCircleArea that takes a parameter radius representing the radius of a circle. Inside the function, calculate the area of the circle (area = π * radius^2, where π is approximately 3.14) and log the result.

// Write a function called isEven that takes a parameter number representing an integer. Inside the function, check if the number is even (divisible by 2 with no remainder) and log true if it is, otherwise log false.

// typeof Operator:

// Declare a variable called myVariable and assign it a string value. Use the typeof operator to determine the data type of myVariable and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable called myArray and assign it an array containing some elements. Use the typeof operator to determine the data type of myArray and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable called myBoolean and assign it a boolean value. Use the typeof operator to determine the data type of myBoolean and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable called myFunction and assign it a function. Use the typeof operator to determine the data type of myFunction and log the result to the console.

// Comparison Operator:

// Declare two variables num1 and num2, each with numeric values. Write a conditional statement to check if num1 is equal to num2 and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable myAge and assign it your age. Write a conditional statement to check if myAge is greater than or equal to 18 and log the result to the console.


// Declare a variable password and assign it a string value. Write a conditional statement to check if the length of password is greater than or equal to 8 characters and log the result to the console.

// Declare two variables num1 and num2, each with numeric values. Write a conditional statement to check if num1 is not equal to num2 and log the result to the console.

// Logical Operator:

// Declare two variables isRaining and isSunny, each representing weather conditions with boolean values. Write a conditional statement using logical operators to check if it's either raining or sunny and log the result to the console.

// Declare two variables age and hasLicense, representing a person's age and whether they have a driver's license, with boolean values. Write a conditional statement using logical operators to check if a person is eligible to drive (age is greater than or equal to 18 and has a license) and log the result to the console.

// Declare two variables isStudent and isWorking, each representing whether a person is a student and whether they are working, with boolean values. Write a conditional statement using logical operators to check if a person is either a student or working and log the result to the console.

// Declare two variables hasMoney and hasCreditCard, each representing whether a person has money and whether they have a credit card, with boolean values. Write a conditional statement using logical operators to check if a person can make a purchase (either has money or has a credit card) and log the result to the console.

// Declare three variables num1, num2, and num3, each with numeric values. Write a conditional statement using logical operators to check if the sum of num1 and num2 is greater than num3 and log the result to the console.

// Assignment Operator:

// Declare a variable total and assign it an initial value of 100. Use the assignment operator to increment total by 50 and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable price and assign it an initial value of 50. Use the assignment operator to decrement price by 10 and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable balance and assign it an initial value of 500. Use the assignment operator to divide balance by 2 and log the result to the console.

// Declare two variables x and y and assign them numeric values. Use the assignment operator to add x and y together and assign the result to x. Then log the value of x to the console.

// Mathemathic Operator:

// Declare two variables num1 and num2, each with numeric values. Use math operators to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on num1 and num2. Log the results to the console.

// Declare a variable radius and assign it a numeric value representing the radius of a circle. Use math operators to calculate the circumference of the circle (circumference = 2 * π * radius, where π is approximately 3.14) and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable base and assign it a numeric value representing the base of a triangle. Declare another variable height and assign it a numeric value representing the height of the triangle. Use math operators to calculate the area of the triangle (area = 0.5 * base * height) and log the result to the console.

// Declare a variable price and assign it a numeric value representing the price of a product. Declare another variable quantity and assign it a numeric value representing the quantity of the product. Use math operators to calculate the total cost of purchasing the specified quantity of the product (totalCost = price * quantity) and log the result to the console.
